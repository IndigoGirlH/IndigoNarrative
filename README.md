### Indigo: Fading into the Background
Upon first glance, the <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="2301,3670,1536,1242">background</span> of Johannes Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring (c. 1665) appears black, especially when viewed against the light blue of the subject's turban. However, thanks to the passage of four centuries, the original indigo pigment used to paint the background has faded, rendering its significance hardly noticeable to a modern audience more fixated on matters such as the subject's identity. The worldwide popularity and widespread use of indigo make this ignorance doubly ironic. The pigment itself is not the only aspect of the painting that has faded: the often violent and exploitative context in which indigo was obtained and used during the colonial period has been largely overlooked for a dye whose widespread popularity has endured for millennia. For the purposes of this painting, it was exported from the Americas to the Netherlands and therefore was most likely produced using enslaved labor. This is one of the many examples of indigo's inextricable linkage with a dark colonial past. The indigo plant certainly carries a complex history associated with colonialism and the exploitation of labor.[^1] When paid greater attention, however, this history reveals overlooked art forms that contribute to a reframing of knowledge that reaches beyond indigo's violent past.

More than 750 species belong to the Indigofera L. genus, and its native range spans Africa, Asia, the Southwest Pacific, the Central and Southern U.S., and the tropics. The genus belongs to the bean family (Fabaceae), and, as a legume, Indigo "can fix nitrogen in the soil, and therefore, it's used as a rotation crop in agriculture to improve soil quality." Perhaps the most well known of its species is Indigofera tinctoria, which, otherwise known as "true indigo," is the dominant species in the Indian subcontinent. Another well-known indigo species is Indigo suffruticosa, which is dominant in Central and South America. While many indigo plants produce beautiful flowers of blue or pink, its dye comes from its distinctive round leaves. Once these leaves are harvested, the blue dye is made through a process of fermentation. Leaves are "soaked in water and churned until they release a navy blue froth," which is then filtered for impurities and turned into a powder or paste. In most cases, this powder or paste is then used to create pigment for paint and a dye for clothing and textiles.

### Ancient & Indigenous Uses of Indigo
The earliest documented use of indigo can be found in 4000 B.C.E., located in what is now Peru. Throughout the Americas in ancient and premodern times, the species Indigofera suffruticosa was used to make dyes for textiles, body paint, sculptures, pottery, and murals. A millennium later, around 3000 B.C.E., indigo in the form of the species Indigofera tinctoria was cultivated in the Indus Valley. This is the location from which indigo entered the European market, and it became known throughout the Roman Empire as indicum. As a consequence of both trade and indigenous cultivation, indigo was also used as a dye in the ancient regions and civilizations of West Africa, East Asia, and Mesopotamia.

### Beautiful but banned
Though indigo had a rich history in the Indus Valley, the initial reception in Europe in the sixteenth century was mixed. Some were astonished by the dyeing power of this freshly encountered plant and were eager to adopt it for profit or personal use. Others had already invested all their capital in woad, which had been commonly used to make blue dye since before Britain was conquered by the Romans. Although it was not as effective as indigo, woad had brought middle-class merchants great profit, and they had gained substantial influence sponsoring the creation of churches, towns, and universities with their wealth. After indigo arrived, suppliers of woad fought their potential obsolescence, and those who were heavily invested in the product fought to keep their profits secure. France enacted a death penalty law attached to the use of indigo in 1609, and, in Germany, indigo was known colloquially as the "devil's dye." England declared indigo a poisonous substance and banned it until 1660. Most dyers throughout Europe, however, ignored the law and mixed indigo with woad to produce stronger vats of dye. The East India Company (EIC), which was founded in 1600, happily supplied the illegal plant to dyers from India.​​ France changed their laws first and became the only legal source of indigo, an advantage that for a time allowed them to become the main supplier throughout Europe. This move gave them a head start in the competition for indigo profits that would continue through the next several hundred years.

### Exploitation in the Caribbean
In the heat of this frantic rush for profit, European countries found that they could plant indigo cheaply in the Caribbean. Caribbean indigo production began in the seventeenth century, born out of economic competition between the Spanish, French, and British, as well as the necessity for indigo to be grown in a tropical climate. The first European indigo plantations in the Caribbean emerged in the 1630s and expanded to include other islands by the mid-1600s. Jamaica, Martinique, and Haiti became prominent indigo producers, with Haiti producing the most indigo throughout the remainder of the seventeenth century and into the early eighteenth century. By 1790, the year before the onset of the Haitian Revolution, there were 3160 indigo plantations on the island. European overseers of indigo plantations relied on both texts written by European naturalists and streamlined techniques in order to produce a successful indigo crop.

Two early modern accounts of the processes of indigo production in the Caribbean, one British and one French, highlight the labor-intensive nature of indigo production. In 1687, Hans Sloane traveled to Jamaica to serve as personal physician to the British governor of the island. In his Natural History of Jamaica, which documents the island's flora and fauna, he describes how indigo was processed in the Caribbean: "Some of the seeds…are put into holes at foot's distance…[it is] ready to cut in 3 months…" The indigo plant is then mixed with water, and after fermenting, is let out of the trempoire to the batterie, where "'tis beat till it granulates…"[^14] The French-named trempoire and batterie refer to the sophisticated steepers and presses devised by European colonizers for the purpose of maximizing productivity. After the indigo is granulated, it is then mixed with more water and placed in sacks with oil beaten into it. Sloane briefly mentions the enslaved laborers who would have carried out this process when writing that "Some negroes and French have been kill'd by its ill savour," drawing attention to the potential dangers of the plant even to those who are knowledgeable about it.[^15]

In 1694, Jean-Baptiste Labat traveled to Martinique for the purposes of missionary work. He continued to make his way through the Antilles and recounted his experiences in his Nouveau Voyage aux isles Francoises de l'Amerique. He also wrote about French indigo production in the Caribbean and provided another detailed account of the technology used: it is produced in three vats that form a cascade from top to bottom. These vats are the steeper, the battery, and the devilling. The steeper is where the indigo is fermented, the battery is where the indigo is beaten, and the devilling is where the indigo begins the process of turning into a dye.[^16] Unlike in Sloane's account, Labat does not mention who is performing this labor-intensive process: that is, enslaved laborers, some of whom were owned by Labat himself. This erasure of labor within the account speaks to a pattern of separating the enslaved from the history of indigo production.

### South Carolina Enters the Indigo market

In spite of the promise of indigo in the Caribbean, near the end of the seventeenth century, the British Parliament imposed an export duty on Jamaican indigo as a means of compelling planters into sugar cultivation in the Caribbean. Around the same time, early settlers in South Carolina had begun experimenting with planting indigo. Due to the War of Jenkins' Ear, British ports were closed to goods from France and Spain from 1739 to 1743. As a result, England officially turned to the American colonies for its indigo supply, and the plant's popularity as a cash crop made South Carolina the wealthiest British North American colony throughout the eighteenth century. This success is usually attributed to the agricultural innovations and experiments of Eliza Lucas Pinckney, who lived in the Lowcountry and managed the colony's most well-known indigo plantation, Wappoo Hall. This is where she first had indigo planted in 1740, when she was just eighteen years old. While the indigo business started to take off, South Carolina still relied on the labor and expertise of Caribbean planters. Pinckney only learned how to cultivate indigo in 1741 with the guidance of Nicholas Cromwell, a white contract laborer from Montserrat whom her father had hired to teach her how to make indigo dye cakes.

       fit="contain">

While studying Pinckney's family records, Andrea Feeser discovered that Wappoo Hall's indigo operations also relied on the labor of twenty enslaved people. While most details of their lives remain unknown, Feeser discovered that one enslaved man named Quash (later known as John Williams) played a crucial role in Pinckney's success. In 1744, Pinckney expressed in a letter to her husband, Charles Pinckney, that she no longer trusted Cromwell and "therefore [desired] Quashy may be put immediately, to make an indigo work of the same dimensions." Williams was a skilled carpenter, and his labor, both direct and indirect to indigo production, was a key component in the success of Pinckney's business. Pinckney valued his labor so much that she freed him just a few years later. Feeser uncovered documents revealing that Williams was manumitted in 1750 and that Pinckney witnessed and signed the documents, which praised him for "good faithfull service." As Feeser notes, this document demonstrates Pinckney's esteem for Williams. Moreover, it reveals just how crucial his labor and knowledge was to Pinckney's enterprise and to indigo production in South Carolina. Of course, Williams was just one of thousands of enslaved workers who made the indigo industry successful.

### Imperialism in India and the Indigo Revolt
Decades later in 1860, Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina Plowden Weston stated that of all the state's youths, "not one… remembers the cultivation of indigo." Indeed, following the American Revolution in 1776, England turned to India for its indigo supply due to political tensions with the newly formed United States. Many English planters coerced Bengali farmers into growing indigo through both lawful and criminal means. One notorious planter named George Meares burned the homes of uncooperative farmers to the ground and successfully petitioned the government to forbid the growth of the rice on land used for indigo. As a response to this poor treatment, the "Blue Mutiny" occurred in 1859, and prisons were flooded past capacity with arrested protestors who refused to sow indigo for English planters. The years leading up to the revolt had seen the beginnings of a national sentiment in Calcutta stemming from "a political struggle against the British mercantile community," as well as "the rise of new social classes in rural Bengal." With a newly heightened political consciousness, the Bengali farmers' collective action continued for more than a year.

In 1860, the Indigo Revolt inspired a new work of art, not of cloth or dye, but of revolutionary theater."[^20] The play Nil Darpan; or, The Indigo Planting Mirror allows us to reclaim knowledge from this time through art. As a postal worker and student of literature, play author Dinabandhu Mitra saw the strife surrounding indigo plantations. For Mitra, the blue stains on the hands of indigo farmers were mirrored by the "stain of selfishness" that marked the British indigo planters.[^31] During the revolts, he was inspired to pen a performance to peacefully combat the cruel treatment farmers endured. Nil Darpan depicts the ways in which English planters coerced farmers into growing indigo through exploitative means. They were often forced to "take out loans and sell the crop to planters at fixed (low) prices, forcing them into a cycle of debt and economic dependence that was often enforced with violence," ultimately leaving the farmer little recourse to improve their conditions.[^32] In the drama's first act, character Ray Churn vocalizes the ryots' concerns when he cries out, "What shall we eat now, and what shall our children take? This large family may die without food…What has the Indigo of this white man done?"[^33] Throughout the drama, the violence and oppression committed by British planters "[results] in either the madness of death of almost every one of the principal Indian characters," and "Not only do the planters ruin the ryots, but they also corrupt the judicial officers of the government."[^34] 
<param ve-iframe

Nil Darpan was the first commercially staged play at Calcutta's National Theatre and became one of the most popular Indian dramas in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In 1861, the play was translated into English by Michael Madhusudan Dutt, then published by missionary Reverend James Long, who was arrested for sedition despite having "omitted," "expunged [and] softened" a "great deal" of the play. In a statement following his arrest, Long writes that he published the translation as a warning to the British of the "volcano . . . forming beneath [the ryots'] feet." Indeed, Long's English edition ensured that the Nil Darpan became well-known, adding a negative hue to the public's perception of British indigo planters once the details came to light. Following the Indigo Revolt, the English established an investigation into the injustices being perpetrated on indigo plantations in India, leading to the 1861 Report of the Indigo Commission. Within the report, EWL Tower, the magistrate of Faridpur, stated that "not a chest of indigo reached England without being stained with human blood."

### Gandhi’s Peaceful Revolution & Champaran Satyagraha: 
The revolts, the play, and the subsequent Indigo Commission did result in reform for workers in Bengal, but they did not end the injustices in the area of North Bihar. During the course of the 1900s and after, synthetic indigo had taken hold, but the outbreak of World War I in 1914 fuelled a demand for natural indigo once again, as supplies of the synthetic product from Europe were disrupted and British planters continued to exploit the labor of indigo farmers in India well into the twentieth century. As such, indigo became an important factor in India's independence movement. After developing his political ideas of peaceful resistance in South Africa, Gandhi returned to India, and his first protests against British rule in his home country were against the working conditions of indigo farmers in the Champaran district of Bihar.
<param ve-image

Due to his reputation as an activist, Gandhi was asked at the Lucknow Congress meeting in 1916 to see the plight of indigo farmers for himself, and he visited Motihari on April 15, 1917. There he was served notice of criminal procedures being enacted against him, as the District Magistrate of Champaran was threatened by his presence and asked him to leave immediately. Gandhi refused to retreat until he had completed his mission, however, and rumors spread among the people that the magistrate had been forced to apologize, spreading hope.  Gandhi wrote to the Government of Bihar with thousands of accounts from indigo workers he had collected via interviews, and officials appointed an enquiry committee, which made "drastic recommendations in its report to improve the state of affairs in the district," which were then mostly implemented by the government.  His agitation on behalf of Indian growers of Champaran became known as the Champaran Satyagraha. Satyagraha is the term Gandhi coined to describe his methods of peaceful resistance, derived from the Sanskrit words Satya (truth) and agraha (firmness or force). His successful protests against the oppression and exploitation of the indigo farmers in Champaran became "the first laboratory of experiment…for his political ideas" and were an important origin point for his peaceful resistance to British rule in India.

### Impact of synthetic dyes today
Though the Champaran Satyagraha was an important step both for India's independence and a more ethical indigo farming industry, health and labor issues for factory workers continue today, even though the use of natural indigo dye has declined significantly due to the creation of synthetic indigo dye. The enduring demand for blue dye in the textile industry has placed synthetic indigo production on a large-scale industrial level: every year, about 80,000 tons of chemically produced indigo are created using non-renewable petrochemicals, generating toxic compounds. Moreover, at least 400 tons of aniline (a toxic carcinogen) are released each year from synthetic indigo production. Two-thirds of this compound is either diffused into surrounding air and wastewater or unintentionally absorbed by plant workers. One-third of the compound remains in the denim that consumers eventually buy and wear. This type of large-scale chemical production creates additional issues with disposal, and because wastewater treatments are expensive, "many facilities dump the spent dyestuff directly into rivers, contributing to environmental pollution." While just 17 production sites are responsible for most of the world's synthetic indigo dye, only one falls under any type of wastewater restrictions. Low-income communities are disproportionately affected by the harmful effects of synthetic indigo production. About 87 percent of synthetic production today is "located in low-wage and lower-income countries," which means workers and local inhabitants are exposed to toxic environments, and workers are compensated for little to no pay.[^43] Although it would be hoped that poor treatment of people in the name of indigo profits would be a thing of the past, unethical practices still remain.

### South Carolina Today: Return to Non-Synthetic Dyes

Julie Dash's 1991 film, _Daughters of the Dust_, uses indigo to reveal the lasting impact of slavery in twentieth-century South Carolina. In the film, the indigo-stained hands of formerly enslaved people are a symbol of bodily subjection and generational trauma. The Peazant family lives on Igbo Landing, and their enslaved ancestors were forced to work on indigo plantations. Though they are no longer enslaved in the film, the stained hands of the eldest generation serve as a reminder of a painful past. Gullah expert Margaret Washington Creel notes that although indigo stains are not permanent, it left indelible "scars" on the flesh.[^44] While indigo stains here represent trauma, they also conversely illustrate the durability of the family's Gullah culture and language. Tiffany Lethabo King considers the image of "porous indigo-stained hands" as a rendering of "black fungibility": a way of  "[visualizing] Blackness as an open state of possibility with the capacity to transform conditions of subjection."[^45] As such, the deep blue of indigo, which also dyes the Peazant women's clothing and floods beautiful shots of the landing's ocean scenery, becomes a stand-in for the family's simultaneous boundlessness, resiliency, and inter-generational bond.

Now in the twenty-first century, natural indigo dye is starting to reemerge in South Carolina's Lowcountry despite a global use of harmful chemical dyes. With England's turn to India for indigo and the popularity of synthetic dyes, indigo production largely disappeared from the state in the nineteenth century. Some farmers and textile artists there, however, have recently returned to the centuries-old methods of processing indigo dye in efforts to move away from environmentally harmful petroleum-based dyes. For example, on a half-acre plot in Adams Run, farmer and entrepreneur Sheena Myers continues her family's tradition of harvesting indigo. For Myers, the plant's revival provides both an eco-friendly alternative to chemical dyes and a way to get local communities "back to the land." Indigo's potential to build community and restore connection to the land is also important to Leigh "Madame Magar" Magar, who offers workshops and dye classes on a former indigo plantation on Johns Island near Charleston. Magar is a textile artist whose "seed to stitch" vision explores the "rich yet tangled past" of the plant. Through her work with indigo, she aims to "face the pain of South Carolina," noting that she "can't continue to work with it and deny that pain, especially as a white woman." Thanks to farmers, educators, and artists like Myers, Comer, and Magar (others include Caroline and David Harper, Leanne Coulter, and Rhonda Davis), indigo production and use in South Carolina today has become a means of reconnecting with the past and subsequently honoring the enslaved laborers who were essential to the crop's success in the eighteenth century.

### "Making and Mending" Indigo: New York Botanical Gardens and SOMArts
Two recent creative projects highlight the importance of bringing overlooked perspectives on indigo to the fore while acknowledging why such perspectives have previously been ignored. In 2022, the New York Botanical Garden planted a new African American Garden at its Edible Academy. Historically institutes that have upheld and practiced colonial botany, botanical gardens, including the NYBG, have turned to projects like the African American Garden in order to address past inequities. This garden intended to highlight plants that were and continue to remain integral to the African American experience. Two varieties of indigo, one of which comes from Ossabaw Island in Georgia, were included in the garden in a plot entitled "Making & Mending," which pointed to the usefulness of certain plants, including indigo. In 2023, the African American Garden re-opened with a focus on "The Caribbean Experience." Indigo was once again included in this iteration of the garden, this time in a plot entitled "Creativity/Creatividad/Kreyativite," a title that highlighted the linguistic diversity of the Caribbean. When discussing the significance of the exhibition in relation to the legacy of slavery in the Caribbean, poet Dante Micheaux wrote, "The contribution of Caribbean peoples to the survival of the African Diaspora cannot be overstated and is the example of liberty and self-determination — the demonstration that Black people could dismantle the global power of morally bankrupt enslavers and build a nation in the colonized world." When applied to indigo, this quote highlights its creative possibilities and its potential for reclamation from the legacy of slavery through artistic pursuits and projects.

Botanical projects are not the only way to mend and reclaim the history of indigo. In 2022, the SOMArts Cultural Center in San Francisco debuted an exhibition called "The Indigo Project." This exhibition, which included textiles, photographs, dolls, and other types of art, aimed to highlight the connection between Black culture and the production of indigo-based art. Created by priestess Bushmama Africa and artist Isha Rosemond, the exhibition was meant to point to, in Africa's words, "Africa before colonization," in which "all the dynasties wore indigo and they had their own print that signified each dynasty." Certainly, the location of the exhibition in the Americas and its emphasis on precolonial Africa makes a connection between the two inevitable and reminds viewers of indigo's significance to the history of enslavement in America. By locating indigo-based art across two continents with an interconnected history and legacy of slavery, "The Indigo Project" seeks to highlight not only the similarities but also the differences between the two: indigo in Africa as distinct from America in the precolonial era and indigo in America as indebted to African artistic traditions.

### Bringing beauty to the forefront
Indigo requires attentive care to create a successful dye, and objects coated in it must meet the air before the remarkable blue slowly begins to appear. Similarly, the history of indigo covers a wide geographic and cultural landscape, forming a sweeping narrative that can only unfold through careful attention. Only once a nuanced and complex story is exposed can the true beauty of indigo be revealed, a loveliness that surpasses the monetary value placed upon it by colonialism, reclaiming stories of indigenous tradition and peaceful revolution through art and community. Though the dark history of indigo may have faded into the background over time, just as it did in Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring, it still has important lessons to teach us. On the one hand, its history contains a grim warning of the destructive nature of greed. On the other hand, it shows the beauty nature supplies when these resources are used artistically and without exploitation.
