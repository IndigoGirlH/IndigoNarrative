# Indigo Plant Narrative

### Indigo: Fading into the Background
Upon first glance, the <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="2301,3670,1536,1242">background</span> of Johannes Vermeer’s _Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (c. 1665) appears black, especially when viewed against the light blue of the subject’s turban. However, thanks to the passage of four centuries, the original indigo pigment used to paint the background has faded, rendering its significance hardly noticeable to a modern audience more fixated on matters such as the subject's identity. The pigment itself is not the only aspect of the painting that has faded: the context in which indigo was obtained and used during the colonial period has been largely overlooked for a dye whose widespread popularity has endured for millennia. For the purposes of this painting, it was exported from the Americas to the Netherlands, and therefore was most likely produced using enslaved labor. This is one of the many examples of indigo’s inextricable linkage with a dark colonial past. The indigo plant certainly carries a diverse history often associated with colonialism and the exploitation of labor. When paid greater attention, however, this history reveals overlooked art forms that contribute to a reframing of knowledge that reaches beyond its violent past.

More than 750 species belong to the _Indigofera L._ genus, and its native range spans Africa, Asia, the Southwest Pacific, Central and Southern U.S., and the tropics.[ref^1] The genus belongs to the bean family, and as a legume, Indigo “can fix nitrogen in the soil, and therefore, it’s used as a rotation crop in agriculture to improve soil quality.”[ref^2] Perhaps its most well known of its species is _Indigofera tinctoria_, which, otherwise known as “true indigo,”  is the dominant species in the Indian subcontinent.[ref^3] Another popular indigo species is _Indigo suffruticosa_, which is dominant in Central and South America.[ref^4] While many indigo plants produce beautiful flowers of blue or pink, its dye comes from its distinctive round leaves. Once these leaves are harvested, the blue dye is made through a process of [fermentation] (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q41760). Leaves are “soaked in water and churned until they release a navy blue froth,” which is then filtered for impurities and turned into a powder or paste.[ref^5] In most cases, this powder or paste is then used to create pigment for paint and a dye for clothing and textiles.

### Ancient & Indigenous Uses of Indigo
The earliest documented use of indigo can be found in 4000 B.C.E., located in what is now Peru. Throughout the Americas in both the ancient and premodern periods, the species _Indigofera suffruticosa_ was used for textiles, body paint, sculptures, pottery, and murals. A millennium later, indigo in the form of the species _Indigofera tinctoria_ was cultivated in the Indus Valley Civilization, from which it received both a European market and its name, known throughout the Roman Empire as _indicum_. As a consequence of both trade and indigenous cultivation, indigo was also used as a dye in the ancient regions and civilizations of West Africa, East Asia, and Mesopotamia. Eventually superseding European woad, indigo from the Indian subcontinent would become a commonly-used dye and lucrative business opportunity at the onset of the colonial period in the 16th century.

### 16th-17th c.
Though indigo had a rich history in the Indus Valley, the initial reception in Europe was mixed. Some were astonished by the dyeing power of this freshly encountered plant and were eager to use it for profit or personal use. Others clung to the older tradition of woad, which had been commonly used as a producer of blue dye since before Britain was conquered by the Romans, though it was not as effective. Merchants who had previously made enormous profits from woad grappled against their imminent obsolescence. France enacted a death penalty law attached to the use of indigo in 1609, and Germany declared indigo the “devil’s dye.” Indigo was declared a poisonous substance in England and banned until 1660. Most ignored the law, however, mixing indigo with woad to produce stronger vats, and the East India Company happily supplied the illegal plant to dyers. There was a fascination with substance, despite the surrounding controversy. A young French traveler in 1687 found that artisans created “an excellent blew dye,” and he hoped to discover their “particular secret” method. He met “an Indian living at Aleppo who paints Boxes and Canes of Pipes, on which he makes a great many Circles, and little points of diverse Colours; but being the only person that knows the secret, he is so jealous of it, that he will not teach any other, and it was to no purpose for Monsieur Bertet to offer him five and twenty Piastres to oblige him to tell it me.” The French legalized indigo first and became the main source of indigo throughout Europe. This allowed them a lead in the indigo market that countries such as England fought to regain throughout the next several hundred years. In the heat of this frantic rush for profit, a wide swath of lands, people, and cultures were stripped of freedom and identity, staining the history of indigo forever.

### Caribbean
Caribbean indigo production began in the 17th century, born out of economic competition between the Spanish, French, and British, as well as the necessity for indigo to be grown in a tropical climate. The first Caribbean indigo plantations emerged in Barbados in the 1630s, and expanded to include other islands by the mid-1600s. Jamaica, Martinique, and Haiti became prominent indigo producers, the latter producing the most indigo throughout the remainder of the 17th century and into the early 18th century. European overseers of indigo plantations relied on both indigenous knowledge and modern technology in order to produce a successful indigo crop. Two early modern accounts of the processes of indigo production in the Caribbean, one French and one British, will be expanded to highlight the labor-intensive nature of indigo production.

In 1687, Hans Sloane travelled to Jamaica to serve as personal physician to the British governor of the island. In his _Natural History of Jamaica_, which documents the island’s flora and fauna, he describes how indigo is processed in the Caribbean: “Some of the seeds…are put into holes at foot’s distance…[it is] ready to cut in 3 months…They mix it with water, and after fermentation, let it out of the _trempoire_ to the _batterie_, where “’tis beat till it granulates…” The French-named _trempoire_ and _batterie_ refer to the sophisticated steepers and presses devised by colonial powers for the purpose of maximizing productivity. After the indigo is granulated, it is then mixed with more water and placed in sacks with oil beaten into it. Sloane later notes that “Some negroes and French have been kill’d by its ill savour,” drawing attention to the potential dangers of the plant even to those who are knowledgeable about it. In 1794, Jean Baptiste Labat travelled to Martinique for the purposes of missionary work. He continued to make his way through the Antilles, and recounted his experiences in his _Nouveau Voyage aux isles Francoises de l’Amerique_. He also wrote about French indigo production in the Caribbean: it is first produced in three vats, and they lie “…one above another, in the manner of a cascade…The first…is called the steeper…The second is called the battery…the third…is called the devilling.” The steeper ferments the indigo, which “…becomes like rotten dung…,” and is then beaten in the battery. Finally, the devilling is where the process of dyeing begins. These two accounts of indigo production hardly mention who is performing this labor-intensive process: that is, enslaved laborers, some of whom were owned by Labat himself.

While some made great profits from the popularity of indigo, some profiteers found that “golden hopes which speculations like these have raised in the minds of thousands, have vanished on actual experiment, like visions of the morning.” Jamaica, for example “once furnished a large supply,” but parliament imposed a tax on indigo and many were “obliged to drop it,” as “several industrious families,” were ruined. When this occurred, French islands such as Hispaniola became the main source of supply throughout Great Britain and Europe. The extreme initial opulence of the plantation owners in Jamaica is often remarked upon, however, alongside stories of “the mortality of the negroes from the vapour of the fermented liquor (an alarming circumstance, that, as I am informed, both by the French and English planters, constantly attends the process).” Conditions were inhumane on many levels, and one account of a dinner party on the Governor's indigo plantation in Surinam states “what embittered the pleasure was, the inhuman disposition of Mr. Goetzee’s lady, who flogged her negro slaves for every little trifle.” One who did not clean the glasses to her satisfaction shot himself that very night before he could be punished, and the author “left the estate Catwyk, determined never more to return to it.”

### Eighteenth Century: Indigo in South Carolina

While indigo often fades as a dye or a pigment, the plant itself is known to stain the hands of the workers that process the plant into a dye, leaving their palms a shade of dark blue. In the eighteenth century, indigo stained the hands of countless enslaved laborers in the United States. Due to the [war of Jenkins’ Ear] (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q54434), British ports were closed to goods from France and Spain from 1739 to 1743. As a result, England turned to the American colonies for its indigo supply, and the colony that produced the most indigo during this time was South Carolina.[ref^11] Indigo’s popularity as a cash crop made South Carolina the wealthiest American colony throughout the eighteenth century, and this success is usually attributed to the agricultural innovations and experiments of [Eliza Lucas Pinckney] (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12745176). Pinckney managed the state’s most well-known indigo plantation, Wappoo Hall, where she first had indigo planted in 1740 when she was just eighteen years old. In 1741 she learned how to cultivate indigo’s dye with the guidance of Nicholas Cromwell, a contract laborer from [Montserrat] (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13353).[ref^12] Thereafter, Pinckney heavily relied on enslaved labor for the success of her indigo enterprise.

       url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Indigo_hands.jpg">

While studying Pinckney’s family records, Andrea Feeser discovered that Wappoo Hall’s indigo operations relied on the labor of twenty enslaved people.[ref^13] While most details of their lives remain mysterious, Feeser discovered that one enslaved man named Quash (later known as John Williams) played a crucial role in Pinckney’s success.[ref^14] In 1744, Pinckney expressed in a letter to her husband, Charles Pinckney, that she no longer trusted Cromwell, and “therefore [desired] Quashy may be put immediately, to make an indigo work of the same dimensions.”[ref^15] Williams was a skilled carpenter, and in 1746 was put in charge of the construction of Pinckney’s Charles Town residence.[ref^16] As such, his labor, both direct and indirect to indigo production, was a key component in the success of Pinckney’s business. Feeser uncovered documents that reveal that Williams was manumitted in 1750, and that he went on to buy his three daughters out of slavery in 1751.[ref^17] By 1763, he owned hundreds of acres of land along the Santee River.[ref^18] Of course, Williams was just one of thousands of enslaved workers that made the indigo industry successful. While his story ended well, the stained hands of countless other workers reveal the extent of indigo’s dark history in the American south.

### End of first half of essay

### 19th c. India
Decades later in 1860, Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina Plowden Weston stated that of all the state’s youths “not one… remembers the cultivation of indigo.” Indeed, following the American Revolution in 1776, England turned to India for its indigo supply. For Bengal playwright Dinabandhu Mitra, the blue stains on the hands of indigo farmers were mirrored by the “stain of selfishness” that marked the British indigo planters. In 1860, Mitra published Nil Darpan (The Indigo Planting Mirror), a short drama that highlights the exploitation of indigo ryots in Bengal under British Company Rule. The play depicts the ways in which English planters coerced farmers into growing indigo through exploitative means—farmers were often forced to “take out loans and sell the crop to planters at fixed (low) prices, forcing them into a cycle of debt and economic dependence that was often enforced with violence”—ultimately leaving the farmer little recourse to improve their conditions. In the drama’s first act, character Ray Churn vocalizes the ryots’ concerns when he cries out, “What shall we eat now, and what shall our children take? This large family may die without food . . .What has the Indigo of this white man done?” Throughout the drama, the violence and oppression committed by British planters “[results] in either the madness of death of almost every one of the principal Indian characters,” and “Not only do the planters ruin the ryots, but they also corrupt the judicial officers of the government.” Nil Darpan was the “first play to be staged commercially at the National Theatre in Calcutta,” and became one of the most popular Indian dramas in the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries.

### Blue Mutiny
In 1861, the play was translated into English by Michael Madhusudan Dutt, then published by missionary Reverend James Long, who was arrested for sedition despite having “omitted,” “expunged [and] softened” a “great deal” of the play. In a statement following his arrest, Long writes that he published the translation as a warning to the British of the “volcano . . . forming beneath [the ryots] feet.” Indeed, the volcano forming beneath the feet of the ryots erupted in 1859. As Mitra was writing Nil Darpan from 1858–1859, he based the drama on Bengal’s Indigo Revolt, also known as the Blue Mutiny. The revolt began in the autumn of 1859 when ryots refused to sow indigo for their English planters. The years leading up to the revolt had seen the beginnings of a national sentiment in Calcutta stemming from “a political struggle against the British mercantile community,” as well as “the rise of new social classes in rural Bengal.” With a newly heightened political consciousness, the Bengali farmers’ collective action continued for more than a year, and while it is generally known as a peaceful revolt, some ryot groups deployed methods of militant violence. The movement led by the Biswases of Chaugacha in the Jessore district, for example, was “violent and armed . . . weaken[ing] the theory . . . of peasants as lachrymose and timid.”

### Commission Report
Long’s English edition ensured that the Nil Darpan became well-known even within the highest ranks of British politics, adding a negative hue to the public’s perception of British indigo planters once the details came to light. Following the Indigo Revolt, the English established an investigation into the injustices being perpetrated on indigo farms in India, leading to the 1861 Report of the Indigo Commission. Within the report, EWL Towers, the magistrate of Faridpur, stated that “not a chest of indigo reached England without being stained with human blood.” The revolts, the play, and the subsequent Indigo Commission did result in positive changes for workers in Bengal, but other parts of India remained exploited.

### Gandhi
Though synthetic indigo dyes took hold in the late 19th century, British planters continued to exploit the labor of indigo farmers in India well into the 20th century. As such, indigo became an important factor in India’s independence movement. The oppression and exploitation of the indigo farmers in Champaran inspired Mahatma Gandhi to pursue his ideals of peaceful resistance to British colonial rule, and as such the Champaran Satyagraha became “the first laboratory of experiment…for his political ideas.” One official Enquiry Committee into the working conditions of indigo farmers at this time stated that “‘the oppression of the indigo factory had on one occasion driven some 200 cultivators to Nepal wherefrom they never returned.’ Yet so great was the influence of the British planters that the Government practically did nothing to check these oppressions.” Gandhi was asked to see the plight of indigo farmers for himself, and he agreed to visit Motihari on April 15, 1917. There he was served notice of criminal procedures being enacted against him, as the District Magistrate of Champaran asked him to leave immediately. Gandhi replied, “I feel it to be my duty to say that I am unable to leave the district, but if it so pleases the authorities I shall submit to the order by suffering the penalty of disobedience.” Gandhi’s peaceful mission meant he was allowed to stay, however, and take an account of all the mistreatments that were occurring. He wrote to the Government of Bihar with thousands of accounts, and they appointed an enquiry committee, which made “drastic recommendations in its report to improve the state of affairs in the district,” which were then mostly implemented by the government. Eventually, due to the unfavorable atmosphere for indigo planters, partly influenced by the popularization of synthetic indigo dye, “all the factories which had once manufactured indigo were sold away in a few years.”

### Synthetic Dyes
Though the Champaran Satyagraha was an important step both for India’s independence and a more ethical indigo farming industry, health and labor issues for factory workers continue today with the creation of synthetic indigo dye. The enduring demand for indigo in the textile industry has placed synthetic indigo production on a large-scale industrial level: every year, “around 80,000 tonnes of indigo are chemically produced . . . with the use of non-renewable petrochemicals and the . . . generation of toxic compounds.” Moreover, at least 400 tons of aniline (a toxic carcinogen) are released each year from synthetic indigo production. Just one third of the compound loss “remains on the denim fabric distributed as commercial products,” while the remaining two thirds “is divided between wastewater, air, and plant workers.” This type of large-scale chemical production creates additional issues with disposal, and because wastewater treatments are expensive, “many facilities dump the spent dyestuff directly into rivers, contributing to environmental pollution.” While just 17 production sites are responsible for most of the world’s synthetic indigo dye, only one falls under any type of wastewater restrictions. Like most environmental issues, low-income communities are disproportionately affected by the harmful effects of synthetic indigo production. About 87 percent of synthetic production today is “located in low-wage and lower-income countries,” which means workers and local inhabitants are exposed to toxic environments, and workers are compensated for little to no pay. Although it would be hoped that poor treatment of people in the name of indigo profits would be a thing of the past, it seems that it will continue indefinitely until concrete changes are made.

### SC Today
Despite the now global use of harmful chemical dyes, natural indigo dye is starting to fade back into South Carolina’s Lowcountry.With England’s turn to India for indigo and the rising popularity of synthetic dyes, indigo production largely disappeared from the state in the Nineteenth century. However, farmers and textile artists there have recently returned to the centuries-old methods of processing indigo dye in efforts to move away from the environmentally harmful petroleum-based dyes. On a half-acre plot in Adams Run, S.C., farmer and entrepreneur Sheena Myers continues her family's tradition of harvesting indigo. For Myers, the plant’s revival provides both an eco-friendly alternative to chemical dyes and a way to get local communities “back to the land.” While farmers like Myers focus on the ethical harvesting of the indigo plant, artists like Arianne King Comer are thinking about how “blue gold” has the power to communicate heritage and healing through batik.

###SC Today Cont
Indigo’s potential to build community and restore connection to the land is also important to Leigh “Madame Magar” Magar, who offers workshops and dye classes on a former indigo plantation on Johns Island near Charleston, South Carolina. Magar is a textile artist whose “seed to stitch” vision explores the “rich yet tangled past” of the plant. Through her work with indigo, she aims to “face the pain of South Carolina,” noting that she “can’t continue to work with it and deny that pain, especially as a white woman.” Thanks to farmers, educators, and artists like Myers, Comer, and Magar (others include Caroline and David Harper, Leanne Coulter, and Rhonda Davis) today’s SC indigo production has become a means of reconnecting with the past, and subsequently honoring the enslaved laborers who were essential to the crop’s success in the Eighteenth Century.

###NYBG 
In 2022, the New York Botanical Garden planted the African-American Garden at its Edible Academy. This garden intended to highlight plants that were and continue to remain integral to the African-American experience. Two varieties of indigo, one of which comes from Ossabaw Island in Georgia, are included in the garden in a plot entitled “Making & Mending,” which points to the usefulness of certain plants including indigo. In 2023, the African-American Garden opened an exhibition with the subtitle “The Caribbean Experience.” Indigo was once again included in this exhibition, this time in a plot entitled “Creativity/Creatividad/Kreyativite,” employing multiple translations to highlight the linguistic diversity of the Caribbean. The link between creativity and indigo once again centers the artistic aspects of indigo through the dyeing of fabrics.

###SOMArts 
In 2022, the SOMArts Cultural Center in San Francisco debuted an exhibition called “The Indigo Project.” This exhibition, which included multidisciplinary works such as textiles, photographs, and dolls, aimed to highlight the connection between Black culture and the production of indigo-based art. Created by priestess Bushmama Africa and artist Isha Rosemond, the exhibition was meant to point to, in Africa’s words, “Africa before colonization,” in which “all the dynasties wore indigo and they had their own print that signified each dynasty.” Certainly, the location of the exhibition in America and its emphasis on precolonial Africa makes a connection between the two inevitable, and reminds viewers of indigo’s equal significance to enslavement in America.

###Conclusion
As mentioned, indigo requires attentive care to create a successful dye, and objects coated in it must meet the air before the remarkable blue slowly begins to appear. Similarly, the history of indigo covers a wide geographic and cultural landscape, forming a sweeping narrative that can only unfold through careful attention. Only once the full story is exposed can the true beauty of indigo be revealed, a loveliness that surpasses the monetary value placed upon it by colonialism, reclaiming stories of indigenous tradition, peaceful revolution, and art. Though the history of indigo may have faded into the background over time, just as it did in Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring, it still has important lessons to teach us. On the one hand, it is a grim warning of the destructive nature of greed. On the other hand, it shows the beauty that people can create with what nature has given us if these resources are used respectfully. Though it has been ill-used, the gorgeous blue of the indigo plant remains intact.
